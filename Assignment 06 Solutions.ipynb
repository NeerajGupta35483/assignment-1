    "**1. In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best\n",
    "way to train a model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A Machine Learning Model is a file that has been trained to\n",
    "recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of\n",
    "data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn\n",
    "from those data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Model Naming —** Give Your Model a Name, Let’s start with giving\n",
    "    your model a name, describe your model and attach tags to your\n",
    "    model. Tags are to make your model searchable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Data Type Selection —** Choose data type(Images/Text/CSV), It’s\n",
    "    time to tell us about the type of data you want to train your model.\n",
    "    ML Models support Images, Text and \\*.CSV (categorical data) data\n",
    "    types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Data Upload —** Upload your data or choose from Public Data Sets:\n",
    "    Choose from public datasets like Jewellery Data set (Images), Gender\n",
    "    Data Set (Images), Question or Sentence Data Set (Text), Numerai\n",
    "    Data Set (CSV) or upload your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Type category(label)** for the files (images/text file) that you\n",
    "    have uploaded and click on submit to begin upload. Wait for some\n",
    "    time till our web app uploads all the files. You can upload images\n",
    "    for as many categories as possible.\n",

    "theorem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The No Free Lunch Theorem, often abbreviated as NFL or NFLT, is\n",
    "a theoretical finding that suggests all optimization algorithms perform\n",
    "equally well when their performance is averaged over all possible\n",
    "objective functions. In computational complexity and optimization the no\n",
    "free lunch theorem is a result that states that for certain types of\n",
    "mathematical problems, the computational cost of finding a solution,\n",
    "averaged over all problems in the class, is the same for any solution\n",
    "method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Simple Words “No Free Lunch” theorem means we can’t rely on one model\n",

    "\n",
    "**3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** In K-fold cross validation, data D is subset into k subsets\n",
    "randomly. Let us assume S1...Sk are the subsets where Sk is the kth\n",
    "randomly split subset of data D. In the first iteration, D-S1 is used\n",
    "for training and S1 for testing the model. When the model has been\n",
    "trained and tested, evaluation can be done, score is noted elsewhere and\n",
    "the trained model is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "These k-iterations go on where 1/k subset of D is always set aside for\n",
    "testing the data and D-1/k subsets are used for training, evaluating and\n",

    "data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, samples are constructed by drawing observations from a\n",
    "large data sample one at a time and returning them to the data sample\n",

    "models and also works on models trained on imbalanced datasets(scores\n",
    "like accuracy scores fail for imbalanced datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler words It basically tells you how much better your classifier\n",
    "is performing over the performance of a classifier that simply guesses\n",
    "at random according to the frequency of each class. Cohen's kappa is\n",
    "always less than or equal to 1. Values of 0 or less, indicate that the\n",
    "classifier is useless Cohen suggested the Kappa result be interpreted as\n",
    "follows: values ≤ 0 as indicating no agreement and 0.01–0.20 as none to\n",
    "slight, 0.21–0.40 as fair, 0.41– 0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as\n",
