    "    in categorical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Frequency Count:** Frequency count is finding how frequent\n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Even in a Well-Designed & Controlled study, Missing data occurs\n",

    "    distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Develop a model to predict missing values:** One smart way of\n",
    "    doing this could be training a classifier over your columns with\n",

    "-   **Data Cleaning:** The data can have many irrelevant and missing\n",
    "    parts. To handle this part, data cleaning is done. It involves\n",
    "    handling of missing data, noisy data etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Missing Data:** This situation arises when some data is\n",

    "            values can be used to complete the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "        -   **Regression:** Here data can be made smooth by fitting it\n",
    "            to a regression function.The regression used may be linear\n",

    "    handle huge amount of data. While working with huge volume of data,\n",
    "    analysis became harder in such cases. In order to get rid of this,\n",
