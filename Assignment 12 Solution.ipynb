    "#### 1. What is prior probability ? Give an example ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Prior probability shows the likelihood of an outcome in a given\n",
    "dataset. For example, in the mortgage case, P(Y) is the default rate on\n",
    "a home mortgage, which is 2%. P(Y\\|X) is called the conditional\n",
    "probability, which provides the probability of an outcome given the\n",
    "evidence, that is, when the value of X is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. What is posterior probability ? Give an example ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Posterior probability is a revised probability that takes into\n",
    "account new available information. For example, let there be two urns,\n",
    "urn A having 5 black balls and 10 red balls and urn B having 10 black\n",
    "balls and 5 red balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is likelihood probability ? Give an example ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Likelihood Function in Machine Learning and Data Science is the\n",
    "joint probability distribution(jpd) of the dataset given as a function\n",
    "of the parameter. Think of it as the probability of obtaining the\n",
    "observed data given the parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What is Naïve Bayes classifier ? Why is it named so ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Naive Bayes is a simple and powerful algorithm for predictive\n",
    "modeling. Naive Bayes is called naive because it assumes that each input\n",
    "variable is independent. This is a strong assumption and unrealistic for\n",
    "real data; however, the technique is very effective on a large range of\n",
    "complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. What is optimal Bayes classifier ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The Bayes Optimal Classifier is a probabilistic model that\n",
    "makes the most probable prediction for a new example. Bayes Optimal\n",
    "Classifier is a probabilistic model that finds the most probable\n",
    "prediction using the training data and space of hypotheses to make a\n",
    "prediction for a new data instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Write any two features of Bayesian learning methods ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A probability distribution over observed data for each possible\n",
    "hypothesis. New instances can be classified by combining the predictions\n",
    "of multiple hypotheses, weighted by their probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Define the concept of consistent learners ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Consistent Learners: A learner L using a hypothesis H and\n",
    "training data D is said to be a consistent learner if it always outputs\n",
    "a hypothesis with zero error on D whenever H contains such a hypothesis.\n",
    "• By definition, a consistent learner must produce a hypothesis in the\n",
    "version space for H given D.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Write any two strengths of Bayes classifier ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** This algorithm works quickly and can save a lot of time. Naive\n",
    "Bayes is suitable for solving multi-class prediction problems. If its\n",
    "assumption of the independence of features holds true, it can perform\n",
    "better than other models and requires much less training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Write any two weaknesses of Bayes classifier ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The greatest weakness of the naïve Bayes classifier is that it\n",
    "relies on an often-faulty assumption of equally important and\n",
    "independent features which results in biased posterior probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. Explain how Naïve Bayes classifier is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Spam filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Market sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Navie Bayes Classifier is used for:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Text classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple classifier that classifies based\n",
    "on probabilities of events. It is the applied commonly to text\n",
    "classification. With the training set, we can train a Naive Bayes\n",
    "classifier which we can use to automaticall categorize a new sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Spam filtering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically\n",
    "words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and\n",
    "then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or\n",
    "is not spam. It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with\n",
    "roots in the 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Market sentiment analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Sentiment analysis is a field dedicated to extracting subjective\n",
    "emotions and feelings from text. One common use of sentiment analysis is\n",
    "to figure out if a text expresses negative or positive feelings. Naive\n",
