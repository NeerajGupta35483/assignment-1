    "\n",
    "It works by analyzing current and historical data and projecting what it\n",

    "**Ans:** The following is the short notes on:\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the sense of machine learning models, what is underfitting? What is\n",
    "the most common reason for underfitting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting is a scenario in data science where a data model is unable\n",
    "to capture the relationship between the input and output variables\n",
    "accurately, generating a high error rate on both the training set and\n",
    "unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does it mean to overfit? When is it going to happen**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the\n",
    "training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance\n",
    "of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random\n",

    "by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In the sense of model fitting, explain the bias-variance trade-off**\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias is known as the difference between the prediction of the values\n",
    "by the ML model and the correct value. Being high in biasing gives a\n",
    "large error in training as well as testing data. By high bias, the data\n",

    "Explain your answer ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Categorical Data is the data that generally takes a limited\n",
    "number of possible values. Also, the data in the category need not be\n",
    "numerical, it can be textual in nature. All machine learning models are\n",
    "some kind of mathematical model that need numbers to work with. This is\n",
    "one of the primary reasons we need to pre-process the categorical data\n",
    "before we can feed it to machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
