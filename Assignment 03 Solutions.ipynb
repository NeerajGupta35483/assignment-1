    "by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine\n",
    "learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a\n",
    "human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns\n",
    "from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next\n",
    "time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first\n",

    "observation represent the features of that observation and their\n",
    "values.At the outset of a machine learning project, a dataset is usually\n",
    "split into two or three subsets. The minimum subsets are the training\n",
    "and test datasets, and often an optional third validation dataset is\n",
    "created as well. Once these data subsets are created from the primary\n",
    "dataset, a predictive model or classifier is trained using the training\n",
    "data, and then the model’s predictive accuracy is determined using the\n",
    "test data. As, machine learning leverages algorithms to automatically\n",
    "model and find patternsin data, usually with the goal of predicting some\n",
    "target output or response. These algorithms are heavily based on\n",
