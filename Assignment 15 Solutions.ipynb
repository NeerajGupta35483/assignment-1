    "**Ans:** The differences between supervised, semi-supervised, and\n",
    "unsupervised learning are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Supervised learning** aims to learn a function that, given a\n",
    "    sample of data and desired outputs, approximates a function that\n",
    "    maps inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Semi-supervised learning** aims to label unlabeled data points\n",
    "    using knowledge learned from a small number of labeled data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Unsupervised learning** does not have (or need) any labeled\n",

    "    learning classification algorithm used to predict the probability of\n",
    "    a target variable. ... It is one of the simplest ML algorithms that\n",
    "    can be used for various classification problems such as spam\n",
    "    detection, Diabetes prediction, cancer detection etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Decision trees:** Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine\n",

    "filter them by class label: Spam or Not Spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of the Classification algorithm is to identify the\n",
    "category of a given dataset, and these algorithms are mainly used to\n",
    "predict the output for the categorical data. Multi-class Classifier: If\n",
    "a classification problem has more than two outcomes, then it is called\n",

    "Support Vectors are simply the coordinates of individual observation.\n",
    "The SVM classifier is a frontier that best segregates the two classes\n",
    "(hyper-plane/ line).\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear model for classification and\n",
    "regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and\n",
    "work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple: The\n",

    "\n",
    "**5. What are some of the benefits and drawbacks of SVM ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The following are some of the benefits and drawbacks of SVM:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   SVM works relatively well when there is a clear margin of\n",
    "        separation between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   SVM is more effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   SVM is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is\n",
    "        greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   SVM is relatively memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Drawbacks:**\n",

    "    -   In cases where the number of features for each data point\n",
    "        exceeds the number of training data samples,the SVM will\n",
    "        underperform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Go over the kNN model in depth ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** kNN is the simplest machine learning algorithm to understand\n",
    "and also to explain. It is a versatile algorithm i.e. useful for both\n",

    "no pre assumption about the data. **Let the data speak for itself.**\n",
    "\n",

    "of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted\n",
    "or classified is denoted by the symbol 'K'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Discuss the kNN algorithm's error rate and validation error ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Training error here is the error you'll have when you input\n",
    "your training set to your KNN as test set. Since your test sample is in\n",
    "the training dataset, it'll choose itself as the closest and never make\n",
    "mistake. For this reason, the training error will be zero when K = 1,\n",
    "irrespective of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN produces predictions by looking at the k nearest neighbours of a\n",
    "case x to predict its y, so that's fine. In particular, the kNN model\n",

    "\n",
    "KNN classifier does not have any specialized training phase as it uses\n",
    "all the training samples for classification and simply stores the\n",
    "results in memory. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm because it does not\n",
    "assume anything about the training data. This makes it useful for\n",
    "problems having non-linear data.\n",

    "outcome of a decision path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Describe the different ways to scan a decision tree ?**\n",

    "**13. In a decision tree, what is inductive bias? What would you do to\n",
    "stop overfitting ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The inductive bias (also known as learning bias) of a learning\n",
    "algorithm is the set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict\n",
    "outputs of given inputs that it has not encountered. The kind of\n",
    "necessary assumptions about the nature of the target function are\n",
    "subsumed in the phrase inductive bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting makes the model relevant to its data set only, and\n",
    "irrelevant to any other data sets. Some of the methods used to prevent\n",
